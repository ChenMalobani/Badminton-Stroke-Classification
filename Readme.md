# BADMINTON STROKE CLASSIFICATION
### AN END TO END MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT

This project is on classifying the type of badminton stroke player played using the data collected from a small wrist device. This device gives us accelerometer and gyroscope data and is attached to the player's wrist. This project was part of Data Analytics course we did at IISc. And it involved everything from data collection, cleaning up till the final ML model evaluation.

This [jupyter notebook](notebook.ipynb) explains "what we did?" and "how we did it?" (the code).
